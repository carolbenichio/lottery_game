# Lottery numbers generator 🎰

Greetings!
To increase my JavaScript skills, i have decided to create a code to draw how much numbers you want from 1 to 60!

<ul> 
  <li>You can change the ammount of numbers to be drawed in "lotteryLenght";</li>
  <li>You can change the interval from 1 to any number you wish!</li>
  <li>You can play as much as you want!</li>
</ul>

Have fun! 🥰
